Object Oriented Programming Assignment 3

For this assignment our task was to create anything we would like using everything that we have learned during the whole year of this Object Oriented Programming module.

We came up with the idea to make a game similar to flappy bird but rather than using the spacebar or tapping a screen to move the player we came up with a voice controlled flappy bird. Basically how it works is depending on how loud the user is then the player will fly high or low. Our game is called DareDevil Below we will explain exactly what happens once the program is run.

Once the programming is run, You will be brought to the Main Menu page which has two buttons. One for the actual playing of the game and one for the Instructions page.

If you click the Instructions button, it will bring you to the Instructions page. Basically there are a couple of images form the game explainging what not to touch while playing and how to control the player.There is also a back button at the left top corner of the screen which may bring you back to the Main Menu if you wish.

If you click on the Play button, it will take you to the page of the game itself. There is no back button added as once you start playing you cannot stop playing unless the player dies. You use the instructions from the Instructions page to play the game. As the player is flying avoiding the pipes, for every pipe it passes through without coming into contact with the pipe the player recieves a point. At the top left corner of the screen is the score contantly updating. If you do come in conatct with the pipes you will lose and be brought to the Game Over page. Once brought to the Game Over page, there will be two scores displayed. The highest score and the score of the game you just played. There will also be two buttons, A Main Menu button and a Play again button. Once you play again the highest score will change, but only if you score higher than the last highest score. Continuing to play beating your own scores.

Also since the game is controlled by sound, at the Main Menu and Game Over pages music will play but once the actual game is being played the music will pause until you are brought to the Main Menu or Game Over pages.

That is all for our game!

The YouTube video link for our demo of the game is :
